Information security spenditure has been projected to be $2.77 trillion for 2016 alone, and the spendings are higher every year. With so much money and
resources spent, we want to find out what it is exactly, that information security is, by looking at what it does, and what it is 
becoming. In continuance, to explain what information security is, has become increasingly difficult; information Security is in constant 
flux. With a better understanding of what information security is, we hope to analyse what should be done about it. We do so by realising
it is a complex combination of many things; not just people, processes and technology. It is also a subjectivising power, creating
new knowledge about us as users, making us its subjects as users of systems and sources of data. Security literally molds us, and
we mold it in return. We argue that to trivialise it as a piece of hardware, or software, or policies is vastly undermining the 
reality of what is going on. In order to make better security, we need to first understand what it does. 

In this dissertation, information security has many meanings; first, we see it as means of protecting sensitive data, which can be accessed
and misused via different techniques. We will focus in analysing socio-technical nature of information security, and especially
two of the most prevalent topics: 1) social engineering, or the misleading of users so that they enable the attacker to achieve his goal, 
2) technology, or attackers targeting data via technical means, such as cracking or network intrusion. It is important to understand the environment in which the objects of desire (i.e. data) resides in, and 
constant change of that environment as everything physical changes (bits change order, drives deteroriate, integrity of data is very
challenging to guarantee over long periods of time), to people and the social in information security. 

We seek to provide a more comprehensive understanding to what information is in a comprehensive manner. We do not seek to separate people,
technology and processes and put our scientific lense on them as separate phenomena. They exist in the same environment, in the same
time, affecting each other. 

We argue that unless we combine all of the elements, our view of information security is incomplete,
and in worst cases, even misleading. Our research so far has revealed that the previous research on topics such as social engineering
has been lacking in the areas of actual empirical evidence grounded on theoretical underpinnings. In fact, we were not able to 
repeat the studies, whereas most provided anecdotal evidence. Instead, we brought about new understanding of social engineering by
taking it from the world of persuasion and provided our own explanation as to why it works as a technique. 
We also seek to understand how information security by what it does, how it subjectivises its users, systems and establishes
perimeters, politics, that it also governs and monitors. We seek to describe it as an order seeking machine, that tries to establish
order in the chaotic environment, and how it is - as well as information security - destined to fail. In fact, it has cannot work, 
except to certain limits at best.

Our research has concluded, that information security is itself a paradox, that often brings new problems, sometimes more, than it 
solves. Adding security always comes with trade offs not always carefully considered. 




( eka ja toka papru) We argue, that information security cannot be grasped should the previous go unnoticed; authors often seek to categorise, which is very common in traditional
science (ref. Foucault XXXX), we seek to understand and conceptualize things in taxonomies; things either are, or are not. What we view
as a forced categorisation into matrixes or binaric models are not conducive to advancing the knowledge of information security.
