According ot Gartner, information security spending is estimated to reach $2.77 trillion for the year of 2016. The spenditures are going higher every year, as public and private organisations face increasing amount of threats. New security concern arise as technological innovations drive society further. Internet of Things, Digitalisation of services developments in the mobile field, just to new few, are molding modern society. Information security is called to protect the previous; some would like to argue they enable them. Previously, research has usually taken a singular approach, dividing information security field into social (or user-centered) and technical (hardware, software, networking) sides. A small portion of research has been devoted to things that are not operational, or the information security making. Such topics include standards, regulations and laws, economic and so forth. We argue that informatn security cannot be fully understood, unless a serious attempt to look at it as an entity is undertaken. Acts of users have an impact on technical security controls, security awareness training (perhaps deriving from regulations) affect users, technology affects users and so forth. In fact, research molds all of these, as new knowledge propagates into every corner of information security making. Our research views information security as a practice in flux, changed by outside forces. Therefore, we argue it is vital to understand the entirety of how information security is done, so we can analyse it. We reviewed several different topics and their research and came to a conclusion that lots of the underlying cornerstones go unchallenged. Our aim is to give it a new reading, analysis and further research based on those analyses. 

In this research, we want to question information security with multi-disciplinary lenses; we will analyse the social impacts, what information security does to its users, and tie it to the more traditional information security, or technical part. We argue, that information security should be looked from the view of what it does – which has largely gone unnoticed – and the way increasing complexity might, under certain circumstances, make systems, or data, less secure. This is our main theme we will examine with all our individual studies and we seek to show that once we understand the underlying complexities, we then understand that by adding more complexity does not necessarily equal better security. Essentially, if the target system is complex enough, it is difficult to defend against unauthorized users. 

We will take the concept of anomaly, and use it as analogous to the term abnormal (lisää liite) from social psychology. In the process of sense-making, we are tempted to categorise, which in essence is a method of exclusion. Exclusion is done when we can find something that is normal and abnormal. Scientific literature and knowledge will provide us the tools for proper categorisation, or exclusion, for example in the case of mental illness (liitteet, tästä lisää omassa kappaleessa, kantaa läpi väitöskirjan). Logically, then, we can analyse information security via anomalies as well. What does normal network traffic look like. Is this machine behaving normally? Is it affected with a piece of malicious code, making it behave strangely? Code, and users can act in malicious ways, based on their actual states and intent. We are not going to dwelve deep into the world of signs and language used in information security, but the concept of normal/abnormal is a key concept. 

Our concept has far reaching ramifications; we are excluding users, code, hardware from the space of normalcy, so the power of information security research is far reaching. With the new knowledge reached, the state of normal is created. Throughout this research, we consider all parts of information security as mere actors, or components of a larger machine that does security. 

Starting from simple detection of anomalies, we can analyse the entirety of information security in a new way, that leads us away from the frameworks and closer to practices as well. Detecting a possible attacked, what is going on in that situation? In human interaction (in the case of social engineering) or human-machine interaction, where the analyst is trying to sort through data from controls to decide whether an attack has taken place. However, to get here, we must first take apart information security, conceptualise and give it a new reading. 

Previously, information security research has been conducted under principles that have been taken as is – CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) of information. We do not seek to argue against the goal, however, we intend to show its means of achieving the goal to be often paradoxical, and often causing completely new problems that escape, as practitioners and researchers alike seek to create a more secure digital world. 

We will take snapshots from three different aspects and analyse them rigorously, with each having their own contribution to the field of information security research. We will start with our own analysis of social engineering, as it is the starting point of our narrative. ”User is the weakest link” is one of the most popular opinions there is in the field. We see this as a good starting point, as it seems to be a popular topic, and yet we know very little about it. Starting from ”the human factor” also provides us an opportunity to contribute to the body of knowledge, which is not large at the moment. If social engineering is the biggest problem in information security, then understanding the phenomenon is very valuable, as the field leans on more technoloy-based solutions. Second, we will conceptualise information security, so we can better understand the relations between users and technology. Third, we will seek to find paradoxes in security, based on findings before. We argue, that adding more information security does not necessarily result into a more secure environment. 

If we trivialise information security and reduce it to mean technology, we are left with a group of controls, cryptographical algorithms and detection and monitoring tools. But, attackers evade controls, dupe users, and simply take advantage of an opportunity, it follows that we need to include people as well. We simply cannot trivialise security to mean users, either. To have a better understanding, we need to seek a more overarching way of look at what it does, and what it is becoming. As the world is constantly changing, so is information security, in constant flux, where everything is connected to something. Fourth, we will seek to understand the technology itself; is more security technology always better? In order to detect a possible intrusion in a network, is it conceivable to go with a single solution for singular view? Or is it better to stack up and have a variety of views. This will be our fourth research, which will finish the research.
